    <h1>The Cremation of Sam McGee</h1>
    <p>By Robert W. Service</p>
    
    <p>There are strange things done in the midnight sun<br>
       By the men who moil for gold;<br>
       The Arctic trails have their secret tales<br>
       That would make your blood run cold;<br>
       The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,<br>
       But the queerest they ever did see<br>
       Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge<br>
       I cremated Sam McGee.</p>

    <p>Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.<br>
       Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.<br>
       He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;<br>
       Though he'd often say in his homely way that "he'd sooner live in hell."</p>

    <p>On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.<br>
       Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.<br>
       If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;<br>
       It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.</p>

    <p>And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,<br>
       And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,<br>
       He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess;<br>
       And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."</p>

    <p>Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:<br>
       "It's the cursèd cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.<br>
       Yet 'tain't being dead—it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;<br>
       So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."</p>

    <p>A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;<br>
       And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.<br>
       He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;<br>
       And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.</p>

    <p>There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,<br>
       With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;<br>
       It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: "You may tax your brawn and brains,<br>
       But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains."</p>

    <p>Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.<br>
       In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.<br>
       In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,<br>
       Howled out their woes to the homeless snows— O God! how I loathed the thing.</p>

    <p>And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;<br>
       And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;<br>
       The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;<br>
       And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.</p>

    <p>Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;<br>
       It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the "Alice May."<br>
       And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;<br>
       Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my cre-ma-tor-eum."</p>

    <p>Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;<br>
       Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;<br>
       The flames just soared, and the furnace roared—such a blaze you seldom see;<br>
       And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.</p>

    <p>Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;<br>
       And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.<br>
       It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;<br>
       And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.</p>

    <p>I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;<br>
       But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;<br>
       I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: "I'll just take a peep inside.<br>
       I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked"; ... then the door I opened wide.</p>

    <p>And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;<br>
       And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close that door.<br>
       It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm—<br>
       Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm."</p>

    <p>There are strange things done in the midnight sun<br>
       By the men who moil for gold;<br>
       The Arctic trails have their secret tales<br>
       That would make your blood run cold;<br>
       The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,<br>
       But the queerest they ever did see<br>
       Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge<br>
       I cremated Sam McGee.</p>
