    <h1>O Captain! My Captain!</h1>
    <p>By Walt Whitman</p>
    
    <p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br>
       The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br>
       The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>
       While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br>
       But O heart! heart! heart!<br>
       O the bleeding drops of red,<br>
       Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>
       Fallen cold and dead.</p>

    <p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>
       Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,<br>
       For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,<br>
       For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>
       Here Captain! dear father!<br>
       This arm beneath your head!<br>
       It is some dream that on the deck,<br>
       You've fallen cold and dead.</p>

    <p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br>
       My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br>
       The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br>
       From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;<br>
       Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!<br>
       But I, with mournful tread,<br>
       Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>
       Fallen cold and dead.</p>
