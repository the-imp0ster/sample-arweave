    <h1>Invictus</h1>
    <p>By William Ernest Henley</p>
    
    <p>Out of the night that covers me,<br>
       Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
       I thank whatever gods may be<br>
       For my unconquerable soul.</p>

    <p>In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>
       I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>
       Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
       My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>

    <p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
       Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>
       And yet the menace of the years<br>
       Finds and shall find me unafraid.</p>

    <p>It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
       How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
       I am the master of my fate,<br>
       I am the captain of my soul.</p>
